/*
 * seg_kmem is the primary kernel memory segment driver.  It
 * maps the kernel heap [kernelheap, ekernelheap), module text,
 * and all memory which was allocated before the VM was initialized
 * into kas.
 *
 * Pages which belong to seg_kmem are hashed into &kvp vnode at
 * an offset equal to (u_offset_t)virt_addr, and have p_lckcnt >= 1.
 * They must never be paged out since segkmem_fault() is a no-op to
 * prevent recursive faults.
 *
 * Currently, seg_kmem pages are sharelocked (p_sharelock == 1) on
 * __x86 and are unlocked (p_sharelock == 0) on __sparc.  Once __x86
 * supports relocation the #ifdef kludges can be removed.
 *
 * seg_kmem pages may be subject to relocation by page_relocate(),
 * provided that the HAT supports it; if this is so, segkmem_reloc
 * will be set to a nonzero value. All boot time allocated memory as
 * well as static memory is considered off limits to relocation.
 * Pages are "relocatable" if p_state does not have P_NORELOC set, so
 * we request P_NORELOC pages for memory that isn't safe to relocate.
 *
 * The kernel heap is logically divided up into four pieces:
 *
 *   heap32_arena is for allocations that require 32-bit absolute
 *   virtual addresses (e.g. code that uses 32-bit pointers/offsets).
 *
 *   heap_core is for allocations that require 2GB *relative*
 *   offsets; in other words all memory from heap_core is within
 *   2GB of all other memory from the same arena. This is a requirement
 *   of the addressing modes of some processors in supervisor code.
 *
 *   heap_arena is the general heap arena.
 *
 *   static_arena is the static memory arena.  Allocations from it
 *   are not subject to relocation so it is safe to use the memory
 *   physical address as well as the virtual address (e.g. the VA to
 *   PA translations are static).  Caches may import from static_arena;
 *   all other static memory allocations should use static_alloc_arena.
 *
 * On some platforms which have limited virtual address space, seg_kmem
 * may share [kernelheap, ekernelheap) with seg_kp; if this is so,
 * segkp_bitmap is non-NULL, and each bit represents a page of virtual
 * address space which is actually seg_kp mapped.
