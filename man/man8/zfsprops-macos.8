.It Sy com.apple.browse Ns = Ns Sy on Ns | Ns Sy off
Equivalent to mount option
.Sx browse/nobrowse.
This option indicates
that the mount point should not be visible via the GUI (i.e., appear
on the Desktop as a separate volume).  Setting it to off will result
in Spotlight being unavailable for the specified mount point.
The default value is
.Sy off .
.It Sy com.apple.ignoreowner Ns = Ns Sy on Ns | Ns Sy off
Equivalent to mount option
.Sx noowners.
Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.
The default value is
.Sy off .
.It Sy com.apple.mimic Ns = Ns Sy hfs Ns | Ns Sy off
Some applications check if the filesystem type is "hfs" and refuse to
work with ZFS. In this situation, this property can be enabled and the
filesystem type will be reported as "hfs".
The default value is
.Sy off .
.It Sy com.apple.devdisk Ns = Ns Sy poolonly Ns | Ns Sy on Ns | Ns Sy off
Create a /dev/diskX pseudo-disk for the mount, which has better
compatibility with macOS UI. Due to the cost of creating a /dev/disk
entry, the default value is set to 
.Sx poolonly
as to only create an entry for the pool's root dataset.
For lower datasets, set to 
.Sx on .
